# Carbon Template GUI

This is a DLL mod template for Scrap Mechanic that automatically supports [Carbon Launcher](https://github.com/ScrappySM/CarbonLauncher), other launchers and manual injection.
It comes with all boilerplate you need, a highly permissive license, an injector, and a simple build system. Along with this is industry standard CI/CD practices allowing launchers to automatically download and install your mod.

## Usage
